WarpingLCS
==========

The intent of this project was to do an optimal implementation of the WarpingLCS algorithm. This is an algorithm which originated the publishing of "Limited-Memory Warping LCSS for Real-Time Low-Power Pattern Recognition in Wireless Nodes" (http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-15582-1_10) to which I am co-author. This code is quite old and out of date and was written by a young me, so pardon any silly code structure.
